A web-based service to generate DnD 5e characters and track their progress across sessions.

## Group Agreement
### Communication Plan
During any brainstorming sessions, at the end of the session we will go around the group and ask each member if they have any thoughts or ideas that have not been shared with the group yet. We will be honest, respectful, and open with each other and our ideas. We all agree that we will have to compromise at times for the sake of the project. We will also support our ideas and stances with well reasoned explanations. If there is a disagreement it will be discussed between members with respect and openness. If a member has an issue or are stuck and need help they can call a 15 minute minimum group meeting so that we can resolve the problem.
### Conflict Plan
If there is a conflict between two members the third member will help to mediate through the issue until we can find a solution. If it is a disagreement between all three members we will have an outside party come in to help mediate.
### Work Plan
We will be using Trello to map the project steps and goals. We will break the project into very small and specific steps and each person will work on one task at a time, not moving on until they are finished with that task. Assignments will be given out on a volunteer basis unless otherwise needed. We will watch the Trello board to ensure that everyone is getting a similar amount of work and getting "meaty" problems.

We will have three mandatory check-ins per day. Once at the start of day, once before lunch, and once before we head home. We will use these check-ins to assign upcoming tasks and assess progress. If progress is unsatisfactory we will assign take-home work accordingly. 
### Git Process
Each member will fork the main project repo and work on that repo locally. At least 1 commit per feature issue. Send a pull request to the project repo after the completion of each feature. When pushing to the testing branch of the master repo we will have a mini code review to ensure that everyone understands what is being added to the project code base. At that time everyone will also pull the new master down to update their local repo. Once main features are functioning properly in the testing branch of the master repo we will pull to the master branch.
