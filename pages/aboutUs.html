          <p>Conor is a Human Being, Oregonian, and Software Developer. His educational background is in the natural sciences and his most recent work experience was in forestry. He is excited by the internetâ€™s ability to advance human understanding and make previously esoteric data actionable.  Eventually he would like to use the adaptability, persistence, and creative problem-solving skills he developed as a wildland firefighter to reduce the cost of ecological data monitoring. Barring that, he just wants to make sweet graphs and solve other interesting problems.</p>
